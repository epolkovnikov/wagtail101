## What is Wagtail?

They say it is the leading open-source Python Content Management System (CMS).

I'd say yes, it is a great "here is your box of parts, go assemble a CMS yourself".

If you expect install and run, - no it is not the case.

## Why Wagtail?

It is free and Open Source.

Building a blog with Django feels like rewriting a WordPress?

You want your users be completely isolated from the design part of it?

You already touched Django and want a boost with pre-built blocks?

You have a feature creep and have to integreate something unusual, or have it more like a Web app?

Or you have to give access to your data via an API along the pages?

You want to get your hands dirty with code.

Your Python is way better than your PHP.
